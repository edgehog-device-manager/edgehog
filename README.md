# Edgehog

**Edgehog** is an Open Source Device Manager Platform designed to manage the entire lifecycle of your IoT device fleet. Built with **Elixir** and powered by **Astarte**, it provides a robust, scalable, and secure environment for maintaining connected embedded systems.

From hardware-independent monitoring to remote container management, Edgehog allows you to focus on your core application while it handles the complexities of fleet orchestration.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Device Fleet Management:** Maintain a bird's-eye view of your entire fleet. Access real-time status, hardware info, OS versions, and telemetry data.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Create and manage software update campaigns. Filter devices by models or tags to roll out updates safely and efficiently.
- **Docker Application Management:** Remotely deploy, start, stop, and update Docker containers on your devices.
- **Geolocation:** Automatically geolocate devices using GPS data, nearby WiFi signals, or IP-based location services.
- **GraphQL API:** Fully programmable platform. Every action available in the frontend can be performed via our GraphQL API.

Edgehog is built on top of [Astarte](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/), the Open Source IoT platform. It uses Astarte for secure device communication (MQTT) and data orchestration.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Deployment (Kubernetes)

Edgehog is designed as a cloud-native application. The recommended way to deploy it in production is via **Kubernetes**.

1. **Images:** Container images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/edgehogdevicemanager).
2. **Setup:** Refer to the [Deployment Guide](https://docs.edgehog.io/0.10/deploying_with_kubernetes.html) for detailed instructions on setting up secrets, S3-compatible storage, and ingress.

### Local Development

To run Edgehog locally for development:

#### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.19.5 and OTP 28
  > Hint: use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install them
  >
  > ```sh
  > asdf plugin add erlang
  > asdf plugin add elixir
  > asdf plugin add node
  > asdf install
  > ```
- PostgreSQL 13+
- A local or remote Astarte instance

#### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog.git
cd edgehog

# requires `just` command runner. Takes care of running astarte and postgres trough docker.
just provision-tenant
```
