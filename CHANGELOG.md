## [0.10] - Unreleased
### Added
- Managed OTA operations expose the update target that created them in graphql ([#356](https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog/issues/356)).

- Ecto SSL configuration is exposed trough `DATABASE_*` environment variables (see [.env](./.env))
- Adds support for trigger delivery policies in the tenant 
reconciler, allowing Edgehog to automatically provision and manage 
trigger delivery policies on Astarte realms that support them (v1.1.1+).

### Added
