# Core concepts

This page will illustrate some of the core concepts used in Edgehog.

## Hardware types, Devices and System Models

This section will deal with the difference between three main concepts used throughout Edgehog:
Hardware Types, Devices and System Models.

To better illustrate this, we will use as example the ACME Inc company, which manages a fleet of
e-bikes and electric scooters. We will illustrate the hierarchy going from the bottom up, showing
how each concept relates to the other ones.

### Hardware Type

An Hardware Type represents the electronic hardware components embedded in an device. As an example,
a possible Hardware Type description could be "ESP32 with a GSM module" or "RaspberryPi 0 with an
LTE modem".

Each Hardware Type can have one or more Hardware Type Part Numbers associated with it. This makes
sure that the user is able to map, e.g., a new revision of the PCB to the same Hardware Type, since
different hardware with the same Hardware Type is assumed to be compatible. Usually (but not
necessarily) the Hardware Type Part Number is a code that is written on the PCB.

### Device

A device is an entity connected to Astarte. A Device has a uniquely identified by its Device ID, and
it usually lives inside a product such as an e-bike (if it is not on a shelf or in a repair shop).

### System Model

A System Model constitutes a group of devices implementing the same functionality for some users.
For example, two e-bikes can be physically identical and still belong to different System Models,
since they can have different software running on them.

A System Model is associated with a specific Hardware Type, so two devices implementing the same
functionality but using different Hardware Types will belong to two different System Models. This
makes it so that the System Model is the fundamental identifier when it comes to software updates.

A System Model has one or more System Model Part Numbers asociated with it, allowing to track newer
versions of a product which do not change its main functionality. Usually (but not necessarily) the
System Model's Part Number is delivered along with the device, or on the box containing it.

Drawing again from our bike sharing example, e-bikes and electric scooters would have two different
System Models, even if they use the same Hardware Type (e.g. an ESP32 with a GSM module). It is also
possible that the e-bikes are further split into different System Models depending on the country
they are deployed in if, for example, the software has to conform to speed limitations which are
specific for each country.

## Tags, attributes and groups

This section will deal with various types of properties that can be added to devices to identify
and group them.

### Tags

Tags are string values that can be freely attached to Devices. There is no predefined semantics so
users are free to use them as they see fit.

Some examples of tags that can be assigned to the e-bikes or electric scooters in our examples
could be `out-of-order`, `test_machine` or `Upgraded Brakes`.

### Attributes*

*_This feature is planned for a future release_

Attributes are namespaced key-value pairs that can be attached to Devices. The namespacing happens
by prepending the namespace to the key using a colon as separator (i.e. `namespace:key`). This
ensures that the same key in different namespaces can be addressed unambiguously.

The attribute keys are always strings, while values support all the types [supported by Astarte
Interfaces](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/latest/030-interface.html#supported-data-types).

The majority of attributes are automatically populated using different mechanisms depending on the
namespaces, but there's also the possibility of manually defining custom attributes for a specific
device.

The supported namespaces are:

- `edgehog-synthetic`: automatically populated with values coming from Device data that is derived
  from Edgehog (e.g. Geolocation, System Model, Hardware Type, etc...)
- `edgehog-policy`: automatically populated with Edgehog values which are imposed on the cloud side
  (e.g. Geolocation disabled due to GDPR restrictions).
- `astarte-values`: automatically populated with values coming from device-owned Astarte interfaces
  using an [Attribute Value Source](#attribute-value-source) with type `astarte-value`.
- `astarte-attributes`: automatically populated using the `attributes` map in the Device status
  returned from Astarte AppEngine API. Since Astarte attributes don't provide a trigger mechanism,
  these attributes are lazily populated and should be considered eventually consistent.
- `custom`: user-defined key-value pairs which are manually assigned to a Device.

Note that all values will be converted to a string when using them as attribute values

### Attribute Value Source*

*_This feature is planned for a future release_

An Attribute Value Source populates the attributes of a Device according to some rule.

Currently, the only supported type of Attribute Value Source is `astarte-value`, which updates
Device attributes using a value from an Astarte interface.

### Selector

A Selector allows selecting a subset of Devices based on their tags and attributes. The Selector
can be evaluated for a Device and return `true` if the Device matches the Selector and `false`
otherwise.

Each Selector can be made of one or more filters, combined using `and` and `or` and (possibly)
parenthesized. When no parenthesis are present, `and` has a higher priority than `or` in
expressions.

#### Supported filters

##### Tag filter

Created with the syntax `"<value>" in tags`, it returns `true` if `value` is included in the Device
tags. It's also possible to use a negative filter with `"value" not in tags`, in this case the
filter will match all Devices which _don't_ have the tag.

Additionally, Edgehog supports pattern matching on tags using the `~=` (matches) and `!~=` (not matches) operators:

- `"<pattern>" ~= tags`: returns `true` if any Device tag matches the specified pattern
- `"<pattern>" !~= tags`: returns `true` if no Device tag matches the specified pattern

Pattern matching supports two types of patterns:

**Glob patterns** (using quoted strings):

- `*` matches any sequence of characters
- `?` matches any single character
- Example: `"sensor-*" ~= tags` matches tags like `sensor-temperature`, `sensor-humidity`, etc.
- Example: `"dev?" ~= tags` matches tags like `dev1`, `dev2`, `deva`, but not `device`

**Regular expressions** (using `/pattern/` syntax):

- Full regex support with standard regex metacharacters
- Can be written with or without quotes: `/pattern/` or `"/pattern/"`
- Example: `/^sensor-\d+$/ ~= tags` matches tags like `sensor-123`, `sensor-007`
- Example: `/temp(erature)?/ ~= tags` matches both `temp` and `temperature`

Note that regex patterns (unquoted `/pattern/`) can only be used with the `~=` and `!~=` operators,
while quoted strings work with all tag operators (`in`, `not in`, `~=`, `!~=`).

##### Attribute filter*

*_Note that while Attribute filters are already supported, Attributes are going to be available in a
future release_

Created with the syntax `attributes["<namespace>:<key>"] <operator> <value>`, it returns `true` if
the value of the chosen attribute satisfies the expression.

The supported operators are:
- `==` and `!=` for all value types
- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` for numeric or `datetime` values

`<value>` can be a boolean (`true` or `false`), a string, a number (either integer or float), or one
of the values supported using special syntax:

- `now()` indicates the current datetime at the time the Selector is evaluated. This can be used to
  do comparisons with other `datetime` attributes.
- `datetime("<ISO8601 string>")` is used to pass `datetime` values in expressions. The string
  contained in double quotes must be a valid UTC ISO8601 timestamp. Example:
  `datetime("2022-06-27T16:27:40.254795Z")`.
- `binaryblob("<base64 encoded value>")` is used to pass `binaryblob` values in expressions. The
  string contained in double quotes must be a valid Base64 encoding of the binary value. Example:
  `binaryblob("Zm9vYmFy")` to encode the string `"foobar"`.

##### Attribute inclusion filter*

*_This feature is planned for a future release_

- `"<value>" in attributes["<namespace>:<key>"]`: returns `true` if `value` is included in the
  chosen attribute. Note that the attribute must be an array for the expression to be valid.
  
#### Examples
  
To provide some examples, here is a Selector to target all out of order Devices in Milan:

```
"out-of-order" in tags and attributes["edgehog-synthetic:city"] == "Milan"
```

Here is a selector to target all Devices that have their service timestamp in the past so they have
to be serviced, imagining this information is contained in the `com.foo.ServiceInfo` Astarte
interface in the `/serviceTimestamp`:

```
attributes["astarte-values:com.foo.ServiceInfo/serviceTimestamp"] <= now()
```

#### Caveats

Note that numeric values are conflated in a single numeric type, i.e. a selector with
`attributes["custom:foo"] == 42` will match either if `foo` is `integer`, `longinteger` or `double`
(e.g it will also match `42.0`).

Another important thing to notice is that using an Attribute Filter will implicitly match only
Devices that have that attribute. As an example, if there are 3 devices, one with attribute `foo:bar
== 42`, the other with attribute `foo:bar == 3` and the third one with no `foo:bar` attribute, the
Attribute Filter `attributes["foo:bar"] != 42` will match the second Device but _not_ the third one,
since it doesn't have the target attribute.

In the future, additional syntax could be added to Selectors to allow filtering based just on the
presence or absence of an attribute.

### Group

A Group represents a subset of devices filtered by a Selector.

The Group can be used to perform operations on Devices contained in it.

Since Tags and Attributes of a Device can change, Groups do not statically define the set of Devices
they contain but they change dynamically following Device changes.

Note that a Device can't be manually assigned to a Group, its tags and attributes must be
used to make it satisfy the group Selector.
