# Edgehog frontend

Edgehog frontend is a standard web UI to interact with the edgehog backend. It's built on top of other open source technologies, such as [`react`](https://react.dev/) and [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/). Like all react applications the first step to work/make it work is to install its dependecies.

```sh
npm install
```

# 🧑‍🔬 Testing the frontend

Testing the frontend is like testing each other react application

```sh
npm test
```

this runs the test suite and watches over file changes to re-run the tests for a test driven development approach.

# 🚀 Run the forntend (manual testing)

First, the frontend needs the backend to work (ideally the backend needs astarte to work). Check out [astarte repository](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) to learn how to run it on your environment, or follow the[astarte in 5 minutes tutorial](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/astarte/latest/010-astarte_in_5_minutes.html)) if you need all the functionality to be fully working.
You can also use the [`just`](https://just.systems) tasks defined in the top level of the repo if you need an `astarte` instance and a working device, but don't want to go through the setup described in the guide.
For most changes, it is usually sufficient to run the backend locally as described below.
First run a postgres instance

```sh
docker run --name edgehog-db -d -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" -p 5432:5432 --rm postgres
```

then run the migrations. Go into the backend folder (`../backend`) and run

```sh
mix ecto.reset
```

finally, run an interactive shell on the backend

```sh
iex -S mix phx.server
```

this starts a local backend instance on `localhost:4000`.

You can then launch the frotend with

```sh
npm run start
```
